# Vocab

`Vocab` in this case is defined as the specific elements being searched for in documents. This directory contains the **static** and **non-static** vocabularies used by most of the featurizers.

(Note: not all featurizers need vocabularies)

## Static

`Static`  = vocabularies that *do not change across data sets*. 

Each .txt file in the **static/** directory contains these vocabs, with the featurizer name using that vocab as the file name. When making new featurizers that require `static` vocabularies, **you must create a .txt file containing the elements you want to count when vectorizing documents**. These files get read in automatically when a `GrammarVectorizer` instance is initialized.

## Non-static

`Non-static` = vocabularies that _**do** change across data sets_

The types of featurizers that use these look for **the counts of the most common things across all of the training data**. Each .pkl file in the **non_static/** directory contains the vocabulary loaded by `GrammarVectorizer` and is automatically generated by *generate_non_static_vocab.py* located in the parent directory. 

The .txt files are ONLY for viewing purposes, and get generated automatically. Editing them does nothing since they're not used.
