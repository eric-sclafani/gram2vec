# TODO
This file contains ideas for future additions/improvements
------

## `pan_preprocess.py` overhaul:
- BEFORE OVERHAUL: write a quick script to get all discourse type counts. Then, write a better one later
- From the raw data, create a new jsonlines file with the following format: 
```python
{"author_id": id, "text": document, "discourse_type":discourse_type},
...             
```
- Create a "sorted" and "fixed_sorted" version of the above. This is essentially merging pairs.jsonl and truths.jsonl
- In `knn_classifier.py`, write a function that sorts by author_id, 


## Additions:
- syntax feats: counts of certain dependency labels, finite verb subject ommision, type of rel clause, 
- morph: embedded finite vs non-finite clauses (I hope that I can leave tomorrow vs I hope to leave tomorrow)
- prosody: do people have a stress (melodic) preference?
- emojis: look for ASCII emojis

## Improvements:

- Document preprocessing and vocab scripts
- change type annotations to use Typing module (for compatibility purposes)

## Issues:
- odd crash when turning certain features off while using cosine metric
- odd parenthesis crash happening in fix_data in pan_preprocess

## When changing data sets, the following need to be altered manually:
- get_dataset_name in `utils.py` has to be updated with a new dataset name conditional
- After generating vocabulary via `generate_non_static_vocab.py`, POS bigrams & mixed bigrams in `featurizers.py` vocabulary paths need to be set to new pickle file generated for the new dataset
