# TODO
This file contains ideas for future additions/improvements
------

## Before PR:

- Important: optimize GrammarVectorizer by loading in all vocabs only once instead of in a loop
- write a readme inside of vocab/ describing static vs non-static
- Rewrite metric learning split code & verify it's working correctly
- discourse eval: just look at eval data
- In featurizers.py: combine `load_vocab` and `load_pkl`, make a flag for static vs non-static

## Features:

- syntax feats: counts of certain dependency labels, finite verb subject ommision, type of rel clause, 
- morph: embedded finite vs non-finite clauses (I hope that I can leave tomorrow vs I hope to leave tomorrow)
- prosody: do people have a stress (melodic) preference?
- emojis: look for ASCII emojis
- John Davidâ€™s distinction between post-speech, co-speech and pro-speech emoji could be a cool feature
- https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.359/
- relook at Document statistics feature (split into two vectors)
- contractions, emphasized text?, 



## Improvements:

- Document preprocessing and vocab scripts
- change type annotations to use Typing module (for compatibility purposes)
- In generate_tabular_vector_dataset: normalize counts if needed

## Issues:
- odd crash when turning certain features off while using cosine metric (may be fixed? need to check)
- odd parenthesis crash happening in fix_data in pan_preprocess

## When changing data sets, the following need to be altered manually:
- get_dataset_name function has to be updated with a new dataset name conditional
- After generating vocabulary via `generate_non_static_vocab.py`, POS bigrams & mixed bigrams in `featurizers.py` vocabulary paths need to be manually set to new pickle file generated for the new dataset
