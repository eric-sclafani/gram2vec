# TODO
This file contains ideas for future additions/improvements

------

## Verbalizer
- Generate a quantitative description of count, OR
- Compare each feature to each feature in an averaged document feature vector (measure with how many standard deviations)(only extract features with n amount of stds from mean)

## Evals:
- dim reduction experiments

## Features:

- Contraction counts
- John Davidâ€™s distinction between post-speech, co-speech and pro-speech emoji could be a cool feature
- relook at Document statistics feature (split into two vectors)

## Code improvements:
- Make `featurizers.py` call `generate_non_static_vocab` on the fly for when new datasets are used
- Revise all doc strings to use numpy format
- 

## Other:
- Start preparing the features for when they need to be multilingual (likely requires a significant refactor)



## To check out
- None
